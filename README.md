# Icewind Dale Voice Pack for EE 2.6+

## Overview
This mod adds the Icewind Dale voices into the Infinity Engine (Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate II/Icewind Dale) Enhanced Edition games version 2.6 or above.

###Note for IWDEE owners
As of IWDEE 2.6, the game only uses 25 lines out of the original 40 the classic IWD shipped with. This mod adds prefixed duplicate voices into the selection menu which does use all 40 original lines in their original roles.

## Version history
### 1.0.0
Initial release.
Adds all 30 sets from IWD1 Complete (including the 6 additional sets from Hearts of Winter).
